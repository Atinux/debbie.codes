  "body": "We need to use the graphql-tag to be able to add our query so first we import this\n\n```javascript\nimport gql from 'graphql-tag'\n```\n\nWe can then make our query listing all the data that we want to receive and ordering by what we prefer. Here we just added an export const called workshop and make it equal to our gql tag which has a query called workshops and that queries the workshops table. \n\n```\nexport const workshops = gql`\n  query workshops {\n    workshops(order_by: { date: desc }) {\n      date\n      title\n      year\n    }\n  }\n`\n```\n\nThen we need to use apollo so that we can get our date to our template. Don't forget to first install '@nuxtjs/apollo', and then add to the moudles of our next config.\n\n```\napollo: {\n    $loadingKey: 'loading',\n    workshops: {\n      query: workshops,\n    },\n  },\n```\n\nAnd now we can do a v-for over all our data and print the title for example\n\n```\n<div v-for=\"(workshop, index) in workshops\" :key=\"index\" class=\"flex\">\n  <p>{{workshop.title}}</p>\n</div>  \n```"
